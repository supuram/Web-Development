In this code base
You will see a navbar in the Home Page and Login and Register Button in the Home Page. If you click
on Register Button you will go to the Register Page where you can enter username, email and password.
These things will then be stored in a MongoDB database.

If you click on the Login Button in the HomePage it will take you to the Login Page but if you write 
the email and password nothing will happen as I have not added the functionality.
