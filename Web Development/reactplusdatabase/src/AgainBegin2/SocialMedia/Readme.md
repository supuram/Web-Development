This includes an authentication system and a friend request system. 
Unfortunately a person can only send one friend request to another as I didn't knew anything about a notification system library and the notification system i did manually can only have one notification and a proper queue mechanism where one notification come after another is not implemented.
Anyways you will enjoy at least understand the logic of sending friend request and its backend implementation. This is my 101th day of starting a journey in software development.
