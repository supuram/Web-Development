/*
You can check if the Node.js process has permission to write to the specified file or directory by using the 
fs.access method. This method tests the userâ€™s permissions for the file or directory specified by the given path.
This code checks if the directory containing the file fs-writeFile.txt is writable by the current user. If an 
error occurs, it means that the directory is not writable and an error message is logged to the console. 
Otherwise, a success message is logged to indicate that the directory is writable.
