Javascript is a single threaded non-blocking asynchronous concurrent language. I have a call stack, an event loop,a
callback queue, some other APIs and stuff. Javascript is made of heaps and callstack. Heap is the place where 
memory allocation happens. Web APIs are extra things that the browser provides. Web APIs consists of DOM, AJAX,
setTimeout. 

See 11:47 of the video. 
console.log('hi')
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('There was a beautiful woman named Ishita')
},5000)
console.log('Ishita')
In this code line 9 comes to the call stack and vanishes, then line 13 comes to the call stack and vanishes. But 
where do the setTimeout function go ? It is not in the call stack.
