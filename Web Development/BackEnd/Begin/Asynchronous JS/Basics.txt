What we need is a way for our program to:

1)Start a long-running operation by calling a function.
2)Have that function start the operation and return immediately, so that our program can still be responsive to 
other events.
3)Notify us with the result of the operation when it eventually completes.
That's precisely what asynchronous functions can do.

<pre readonly class="event-log"></pre> - The <pre> HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be 
presented exactly as written in the HTML file.

The loadend event is fired when a request has completed, whether successfully (after load) or unsuccessfully 
(after abort or error)

4)XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having 
to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user 
is doing.
