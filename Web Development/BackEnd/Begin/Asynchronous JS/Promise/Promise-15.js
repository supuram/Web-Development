// I want to remove() all docs
db.allDocs({include_docs: true}).then(function (result) {
    result.rows.forEach(function (row) {
      db.remove(row.doc);  
    });
  }).then(function () {
    // I naively believe all docs have been removed() now!
});
/**
*! Q)Help me understand this code .
Clue - What's the problem with this code? The problem is that the first function is actually returning undefined, 
meaning that the second function isn't waiting for db.remove() to be called on all the documents. In fact, it 
isn't waiting on anything, and can execute when any number of docs have been removed! 

*? Ans)The provided code attempts to remove all documents from a database using the `db.allDocs()` function and 
*? `db.remove()` function. However, there is a problem with the code as described in the clue.

The issue is that the `db.remove()` function is an asynchronous operation that returns a Promise. In the code, 
the `forEach()` loop inside the first `.then()` block iterates over each document and calls `db.remove()`. 
However, since `db.remove()` is asynchronous, it does not wait for the removal to complete before moving to the 
next iteration. As a result, the loop will initiate multiple removal operations simultaneously without waiting 
for them to finish.

*? Additionally, the first `.then()` block does not return a Promise, which means that the subsequent `.then()` 
*? block is not properly chained to the completion of the removal operations. This causes the second function to 
*? execute immediately after the loop starts, without waiting for any of the removals to complete.

To fix this code, you can use `Promise.all()` to wait for all the removal operations to complete before moving to 
the next `.then()` block. Here's an updated version:

db.allDocs({ include_docs: true }).then(function (result) {
  var removalPromises = result.rows.map(function (row) {
    return db.remove(row.doc);
  });

  return Promise.all(removalPromises);
}).then(function () {
  console.log("All documents have been removed successfully.");
}).catch(function (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred:", error);
});

In the updated code:

1. The `map()` function is used to create an array of removal promises by iterating over the `result.rows` array. 
Each `db.remove()` call returns a Promise for each document.

2. `Promise.all()` is used to wait for all removal promises to resolve. This ensures that the subsequent 
`.then()` block is executed only after all removal operations have completed.

3. The second `.then()` block is properly chained to the completion of all removal operations, indicating that 
all documents have been removed successfully. If any error occurs during the removal process, the `.catch()` 
block will handle it.

By using `Promise.all()` and properly chaining the promises, the code ensures that all documents are removed 
before proceeding to the next step, providing the expected behavior.
