Now, when we're talking about APIs, you will often need to think about things including endpoints, paths,

parameters, and authentication.

The first thing I want to show you is an API endpoint. Every API that interacts with a external system,

like a server, will have an endpoint.

In addition to endpoints, there’s also API paths and parameters that you can use in order to narrow down on a 

specific piece of data you want from an external server. 

So every time you make a request through the API, they have to be able to identify you as the developer,

and they have to keep track of how often you're using their server to get data, and then charge you, or

limit you, accordingly. In order to illustrate this concept of authentication,

we’re going to use the openweathermap.
