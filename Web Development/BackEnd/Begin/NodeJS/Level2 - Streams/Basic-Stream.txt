Streams are used to read or write sequentially. When we have to handle and manipulate streaming data, for eg - 
continuous source or a big file - streams come in handy. 
Four different types of streams - Writeable, Readable, Duplex, Transform. Duplex is used to both read and write
data sequentially. Transform modiefies data while writing or reading. 

const first = await readFile('textFile.txt', 'utf8') Here you have stored the textFile in first. But if the file 
is too big first cannot store that file. So that time we use stream.
