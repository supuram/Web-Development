/*
display: flex activates the flexbox layout mode on an element. This means that the element becomes 
a flex container and its children become flex items. The flex container distributes space along a 
single column or row, depending on the flex-direction property.

There are several other properties that can be used to control the layout of flex items within a flex 
container. These include flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, and align-content.

In this example, the .container element becomes a flex container and its children (the .box elements) 
become flex items. The flex: 1 property applied to the .box elements causes them to grow and fill the 
available space within the container equally.

flex: 1 is a shorthand property that sets the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties of a 
flex item. When you set flex: 1, it is equivalent to setting flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, and 
flex-basis: 0.

This means that the flex item is allowed to grow and shrink in order to fill the available space 
within the flex container. The flex-grow property specifies how much the item will grow relative to 
the other flex items, while the flex-shrink property specifies how much the item will shrink relative 
to the other flex items.

In the example I gave earlier, setting flex: 1 on the .box elements causes them to grow and fill the 
available space within the container equally. This is because all of the flex items have the same 
flex-grow value (1), so they will all grow at the same rate.
