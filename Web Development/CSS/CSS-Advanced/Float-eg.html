        <p>Birds in mountain are a diverse group of animals that live in high-elevation habitats. Some of them are endemic to specific mountain ranges, such as the Bicknell’s thrush in the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada1, while others are migratory and travel long distances between their breeding and wintering grounds, such as the blackpoll warbler that flies non-stop over the Atlantic Ocean1. Some of them are rare and threatened, such as the white-winged duck in India2, while others are common and widespread, such as the ruddy shelduck in Eurasia2. Some of them are adapted to cold and harsh conditions, such as the tundra swan that breeds in the Arctic2, while others are more tolerant of warm and humid climates, such as the cotton pygmy goose that inhabits tropical wetlands2. Birds in mountain are fascinating creatures that have evolved to cope with the challenges and opportunities of living at high altitudes.</p>
