    <p>I was born from a tiny seed that fell from a bird's beak. I landed on a rocky slope of a mountain, where the soil was thin and the wind was harsh. I had to struggle to survive, but I was determined to grow. I sent my roots deep into the cracks of the rocks, and stretched my stem towards the sun. I sprouted my first leaves, which were small and tough to resist the cold and dry air.
