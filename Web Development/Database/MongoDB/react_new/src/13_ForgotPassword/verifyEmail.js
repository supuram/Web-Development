/**
*! Q)From where does this client side code getting the verificationToken named as token here ? I mean 
*! verification token is generated by the server side via const verificationToken = generateVerificationToken();
Ans)The token value in the client-side code is being obtained from the URL using the useParams hook from the 
react-router-dom library. The useParams hook returns an object containing the route parameters extracted from 
the URL path. In this case, the route is defined to include a token parameter, so the value of the token parameter
can be accessed using const { token } = useParams().

The value of the token parameter in the URL should be the verification token that was generated by the server-side
code and included in the verification link sent to the user’s email address. When the user clicks on the 
verification link, their browser will navigate to the URL specified in the link, which should include the 
verification token as a route parameter. The client-side code can then extract the verification token from the 
URL using the useParams hook and use it to verify the user’s email address.

*! Q)But how does the client side code understand that it has to extract the verificationToken of the email only? 
*! There are so many other verification token flying around. Doesn't the code gets confused about which token to 
*! actually pick up?
Ans)The client-side code knows which verification token to extract from the URL because the verification token is 
included as a route parameter in the URL path. When the server-side code generates the verification link, it 
includes the verification token as a route parameter in the URL. For example, if the verification token is 12345, 
the verification link might look like this: http://localhost:3000/verify/12345.

When the user clicks on the verification link, their browser navigates to the specified URL, which includes the 
verification token as a route parameter. The client-side code can then use the useParams hook from the react-rout
er-dom library to extract the value of the token route parameter from the URL path. Since the value of the token 
route parameter is set by the server-side code when generating the verification link, it will always be the 
correct verification token for that user.

*! Q)What does useParams do ?
Ans)`useParams` is a hook from the `react-router-dom` library that returns an object containing the route 
parameters extracted from the URL path. Route parameters are named segments of the URL path that are defined 
using a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name. For example, in the route path `/verify/:token`, `:token` is 
a route parameter named `token`.

When a user navigates to a URL that matches the route path, the value of the route parameter is extracted from 
the URL and made available to the component via the `useParams` hook. For example, if a user navigates to the 
URL `/verify/12345`, the value of the `token` route parameter would be `'12345'`.

Here's an example of how you could use the `useParams` hook to extract the value of a route parameter:

import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { token } = useParams();
  // ...
}

In this example, we're using object destructuring to extract the value of the `token` route parameter from the 
object returned by the `useParams` hook. The value of the `token` variable will be equal to the value of the 
`token` route parameter in the URL.

When the server-side code generates the verification link, it includes the verification token as a route 
parameter in the URL. For example, if the verification token is 12345, the verification link might look like 
this: http://localhost:3000/verify/12345.

When the user clicks on the verification link, their browser navigates to the specified URL, which includes the 
verification token as a route parameter. The client-side code can then use the useParams hook to extract the 
value of the token route parameter from the URL path.

*! Q)When the user clicks on the verification link, their browser navigates to the specified URL, which includes 
*! the verification token as a route parameter. But how does useParams know that it has to extract the value of 
*! the token from that exact link. nowhere in the code it is instructed to the useParams ?
Ans)useParams is a hook from the react-router-dom library that returns an object containing the route parameters 
extracted from the URL path. It knows which route parameter to extract from the URL based on the route definition 
in your client-side code.

When you define a route using the Route component from the react-router-dom library, you specify the path of the 
route using the path prop. The path prop can include route parameters, which are defined using a colon (:) 
followed by the parameter name. For example, if you define a route like this: <Route path="/verify/:token" 
component={MyComponent} />, then any value passed in the URL after /verify/ will be captured as a route parameter 
named token.

When a user navigates to a URL that matches the route path, the useParams hook can be used inside the MyComponent 
component to extract the value of the token route parameter from the URL. Since the route definition specifies 
that there is a token route parameter in the URL path, useParams knows to extract its value and make it available 
to your component.

*! Q)But the token value does not get generated on the client side. its generated by the server side. but nowhere 
*! in the server side code it is passed to the client. how does the client side even get the value of it? Its 
*! only passed as <a href="http://localhost:3000/LoginPage?token=${verificationToken}">Verify Email</a>`.
Ans)Apologies for the confusion. Based on your updated explanation, it seems that the token value is indeed 
generated on the server side and then passed to the client side for inclusion in the URL.

In your example, the server generates a verification token using the `generateVerificationToken()` function, 
which returns a randomly generated token. This token is then included in the URL as a query parameter when 
generating the "Verify Email" link.

The link you provided `<a href="http://localhost:3000/LoginPage?token=${verificationToken}">Verify Email</a>` 
includes the `verificationToken` value as a query parameter named `token`. When a user clicks on this link, it 
will navigate them to the `LoginPage` route with the token value appended to the URL.

On the client side, when the `VerifyEmailPage` component is rendered, the `useParams()` hook is used to extract 
the token value from the URL. Since the token is included as a query parameter (`?token=<value>`), it can be 
accessed using `useParams().token`.

To summarize:

1. The server generates a verification token using `generateVerificationToken()` and stores it.
2. The server includes the token in the "Verify Email" link as a query parameter (`?token=<value>`).
3. The client receives the link with the token and clicks on it.
4. The client is redirected to the `LoginPage` route with the token value in the URL.
5. The `VerifyEmailPage` component on the client side uses the `useParams().token` to extract the token value from the URL and performs further actions like making a request to the server for email verification.

So, the client side does not directly receive the value of `verificationToken` from the server. Instead, the 
token value is passed to the client through the URL as a query parameter, and the client extracts it using the 
`useParams().token` syntax.

*! Q)Explain  verifyEmail(token);}, [token]);
Ans)The verifyEmail(token) is a function call within the useEffect hook. It invokes the verifyEmail function and 
passes the token as an argument.

The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in React components. It takes a function as its first argument,
and an array of dependencies as its second argument. The function inside the useEffect hook is executed after the 
component is mounted and whenever any of the dependencies in the array change.

In this case, the useEffect hook is used to execute the verifyEmail function when the token dependency changes. 
This means that whenever the token value received from useParams() changes (e.g., due to a new token being passed 
in the URL), the verifyEmail function will be called again.

The purpose of this code is to trigger the email verification process by making an HTTP GET request to the server 
when the token changes. It uses axios library to make the GET request to the /verify/${token} endpoint on the 
server. If the request is successful, the response data is logged to the console. If there's an error, it is 
logged to the console as well.

By including [token] as the dependency array in the useEffect hook, it ensures that the effect is re-run whenever 
the token value changes. This allows the email verification process to be triggered again whenever a new token is 
provided in the URL.

*! Q)Why is token passed as  [token] and not as token
Ans)The `token` value is passed as `[token]` in the dependency array of the `useEffect` hook to specify that the 
effect should be re-run whenever the `token` value changes.

When you pass a variable or a value directly in the dependency array, it would be treated as a new value every 
render, and the effect would be triggered on every render. However, in most cases, you want the effect to be 
executed only when specific values have changed.

By wrapping the `token` value in an array `[token]`, you're creating a dependency array with a single element, 
the `token` value. This tells React to only re-run the effect if the `token` value changes between renders.

By including `[token]` in the dependency array, the effect will be triggered only when the `token` value changes. 
If the `token` remains the same between renders, the effect won't be re-executed. This helps optimize the 
performance of the component and avoids unnecessary network requests in cases where the `token` value hasn't 
changed.

In summary, using `[token]` as the dependency array ensures that the effect is re-run only when the `token` value 
changes, providing more control over when the email verification process is triggered.
