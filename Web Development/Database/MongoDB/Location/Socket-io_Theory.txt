const socketHandler = (io) => {
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      console.log('A user connected');
      socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('A user disconnected');
      });
    });
};

Sure, here's an explanation of the code you provided:

1. `const socketHandler = (io) => { ... }`: This line defines a constant variable named `socketHandler` and assigns
it to an arrow function that takes one argument, `io`.
2. `io.on('connection', (socket) => { ... })`: This line sets up an event listener on the `io` object for the 
`'connection'` event. When a client connects to the server, the callback function is called with a `socket` object 
representing the connection to the client.
3. `console.log('A user connected')`: This line logs the message `'A user connected'` to the console when a client 
connects to the server.
4. `socket.on('disconnect', () => { ... })`: This line sets up an event listener on the `socket` object for the 
`'disconnect'` event. When a client disconnects from the server, the callback function is called.
5. `console.log('A user disconnected')`: This line logs the message `'A user disconnected'` to the console when a 
client disconnects from the server.
This code defines a function named `socketHandler` that takes an instance of a Socket.IO server (`io`) as an 
argument. The function sets up event listeners on the server to log messages to the console when clients connect 
and disconnect.

Q)socket.on('disconnect'...
How does the code understands that 'disconnect' is disconnect from the server? Is it predefined in socket.io? If 
i use any other event say 'discont' will it not indicate disconnect ?
Ans)Yes, 'disconnect' is a predefined event in Socket.IO that is emitted when a client disconnects from the server. 
The socket.on('disconnect', ...) line sets up an event listener for this specific event.
If you use a different event name, such as 'discont', it will not automatically indicate a disconnect. You would 
need to manually emit that event from the client-side code using socket.emit('discont') and set up a corresponding 
event listener on the server-side using socket.on('discont', ...). However, itâ€™s recommended to use the built-in 
'disconnect' event for handling disconnections.

Q)Is (io) and 'connection' predefined in socket.io?
Ans)Yes, io and 'connection' are both predefined in Socket.IO.

io is an instance of the Server class in Socket.IO, which represents a Socket.IO server. It is usually created by 
calling the require('socket.io')(httpServer) function, where httpServer is an instance of a Node.js HTTP server.

The 'connection' event is a predefined event in Socket.IO that is emitted on the server-side when a new client 
connects to the server. You can listen for this event using the io.on('connection', (socket) => { ... }) method, 
where the callback function is called with a socket object representing the connection to the client.

Q)io.on('connection') is emitted by the server ?
Ans)Yes, the connection event is emitted by the socket.io server when a new client connects to it. In the code you 
provided earlier, the io variable represents a socket.io server instance, and the io.on('connection', ...) line 
sets up an event listener for the connection event on the server. When a new client connects to the server, the 
callback function passed as the second argument to the on method is called with a socket object representing the 
connected client as its argument.

Q)io.on('connection', (socket) => {
Here connection is the event and socket is the listener. but where do you raise the event 'connection'?
Ans)In the code you provided, `connection` is the name of the event that is being listened for, and the second 
argument to the `on` method is a callback function that is called when the event is emitted. The `socket` parameter 
of the callback function represents the `socket` object associated with the connected client.

The `connection` event is automatically emitted by the `socket.io` server whenever a new client connects to it. You
do not need to manually emit this event. When a new client connects to the server, the server will automatically 
emit the `connection` event and call any event listeners that have been registered for this event, passing the 
`socket` object associated with the connected client as an argument to the callback function.

Q)io.on('connection', (socket) => 
So here socket is the listener too and is called when the event is raised?
Ans)In the code you provided, `socket` is not the listener, but rather a parameter of the callback function that is 
called when the `connection` event is emitted by the `socket.io` server. The listener in this case is the callback 
function itself, which is passed as the second argument to the `on` method.
When a new client connects to the `socket.io` server, the server emits the `connection` event and calls any event 
listeners that have been registered for this event. In this case, the event listener is the callback function that 
you provided as the second argument to the `on` method. When this callback function is called, it is passed as a 
`socket` object representing the connected client as its first argument. This `socket` object can be used to 
communicate with the connected client and to listen for events emitted by the client.

Q)What purpose does on and io serve ? 
Ans)In the code you provided, `io` is a variable that represents a `socket.io` server instance. The `on` method is
a method of the `Server` class from the `socket.io` library, which is used to register event listeners on the 
server instance.

The `on` method takes two arguments: the name of the event to listen for, and a callback function to be called when 
the event is emitted. In the code you provided, the `io.on('connection', ...)` line registers an event listener for
the `connection` event on the `socket.io` server instance represented by the `io` variable. When a new client 
connects to the server, the server will emit the `connection` event and call any event listeners that have been 
registered for this event, including the callback function that you provided as the second argument to the `on` 
method.

In summary, the purpose of the `io` variable in this code is to represent a `socket.io` server instance, and the 
purpose of the `on` method is to register event listeners on the server instance.

Q)And if i have a website on a server , then , when a client connects on my website does my website 's server 
triggers an event on the socket.io server and here my website's server is acting as the client of socket.io server ? 
Or does the client of my website connect to the server of socket.io directly ?
Ans)If you have a website hosted on a server, and you want to use `socket.io` to enable real-time communication 
between the clients of your website and the server, you would typically set up a `socket.io` server on the same 
server where your website is hosted.

When a client visits your website, their web browser would load the `socket.io` client library and use it to 
establish a connection to the `socket.io` server. This connection is separate from the initial HTTP connection 
used to load the website.

Once the connection between the client and the `socket.io` server has been established, the `socket.io` server 
would emit a `connection` event and call any event listeners that have been registered for this event. The client 
can then communicate with the server in real-time using `socket.io` events.

In this scenario, the client of your website connects directly to the `socket.io` server, and the `socket.io` 
server is typically located on the same server as your website.

Q)socket.on('disconnect', () =>{
In this case , does the disconnect event being raised by the client side ? Also since no argument is passed inside 
the callback function, who will handle the server side ?
Ans)Yes, the disconnect event is emitted by the socket.io client when it disconnects from the server. In the code 
you provided, the socket.on('disconnect', ...) line sets up an event listener for the disconnect event on the 
socket object representing a connected client.

When the client disconnects from the server, the server will automatically emit the disconnect event on the socket 
object associated with the disconnected client, and call any event listeners that have been registered for this 
event, including the callback function that you provided as the second argument to the on method.

In this case, no arguments are passed to the callback function when it is called. The callback function can still 
perform any necessary actions on the server side in response to the client disconnecting, such as cleaning up 
resources associated with the disconnected client or logging a message. The specific actions that are performed 
depend on the implementation of the callback function.

Q)io.on('connection', (socket) => {
Here does the callback function perform necessary action on the client side and the event is emitted by the 
server ?
Ans)In the code you provided, the `io.on('connection', ...)` line sets up an event listener for the `connection` 
event on the `socket.io` server instance represented by the `io` variable. The callback function passed as the 
second argument to the `on` method is called on the server side when a new client connects to the server.

When a new client connects to the server, the server emits the `connection` event and calls any event listeners 
that have been registered for this event, including the callback function that you provided as the second argument 
to the `on` method. The callback function is passed a `socket` object representing the connected client as its 
first argument.

The callback function can perform any necessary actions on the server side in response to a new client connecting, 
such as setting up event listeners on the `socket` object to listen for events emitted by the client, or sending a 
welcome message to the client. The specific actions that are performed depend on the implementation of the callback 
function.

Q)server.listen(5000, async () => {
    try {
        socketHandler(io)
        await watcher(io)
    }
    catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
    }
})
What does the above code do ?

The `server.listen` method is used to start the HTTP server and begin listening for incoming connections on the 
specified port, in this case, port 5000. The first argument to the `server.listen` method is the port number, and 
the second argument is a callback function that is called when the server starts listening.

In the code you provided, the callback function passed to `server.listen` performs two actions:

1. It calls the `socketHandler` function, passing it the `io` object as an argument. The `socketHandler` function 
sets up event listeners for the Socket.io server, allowing it to handle incoming connections from clients and 
respond to events emitted by those clients.

2. It calls the `watcher` function, passing it the `io` object as an argument. The `watcher` function sets up a 
change stream on the `products` collection in the MongoDB database, allowing it to watch for changes to the data 
in that collection in real-time. When a change occurs, the `watcher` function emits an event to connected clients 
using Socket.io, notifying them of the change.

The callback function also includes a `try...catch` block that catches any errors that may occur while setting up 
the Socket.io server or the change stream. If an error occurs, it is logged to the console using `console.error`.

In summary, this code starts an HTTP server listening on port 5000 and sets up a Socket.io server and a MongoDB 
change stream to enable real-time communication between connected clients and the server.

Q)const io = require('socket.io')(server);
What value does io takes ?

Ans)In the code you provided, `io` is a variable that is assigned the value returned by calling the 
`require('socket.io')` function with the `server` object as an argument.

The `require('socket.io')` function returns a function that can be called with an HTTP server object to create a 
new instance of the Socket.io `Server` class. When you call this function with the `server` object as an argument, 
it creates a new Socket.io server that is attached to the HTTP server and can handle incoming connections from 
clients.

The value assigned to the `io` variable is an instance of the Socket.io `Server` class. This object represents 
the Socket.io server and provides methods for handling incoming connections, sending and receiving messages, 
and managing connected clients.

You can use the `io` object to set up event listeners for the Socket.io server, emit events to connected clients, 
and perform other actions related to real-time communication between the server and clients.

Q)Based on the previous question-
What is an http server object?
Ans)An HTTP server object is an instance of the http.Server class in Node.js. This class is used to create HTTP 
servers that can listen for incoming requests from clients and respond to them.

To create an HTTP server object, you can use the http.createServer method, which takes a request listener function 
as an argument and returns a new instance of the http.Server class. The request listener function is called each 
time the server receives a new request from a client, and is responsible for handling the request and sending a 
response.

Once you have created an HTTP server object, you can use its listen method to start listening for incoming requests
on a specified port. The server will then be able to accept incoming connections from clients and call the request 
listener function to handle each incoming request.
Here is an example of how to create an HTTP server object in Node.js:
const http = require('http');
const requestListener = (req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('Hello, World!');
}
const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});

In this example, the http module is imported and used to create a new HTTP server object using the 
http.createServer method. The createServer method takes a request listener function as an argument, which is 
called each time the server receives a new request from a client.

In this case, the request listener function simply writes a 200 status code to the response object, indicating that 
the request was successful, and sends a response body containing the string 'Hello, World!'.

After creating the server object, its listen method is called to start listening for incoming requests on port 
3000. When the server starts listening, it logs a message to the console indicating that it is ready to accept 
incoming connections.

Q)Based on the previous question-
The `require('socket.io')` function returns a function that can be called with an HTTP server object to create a 
new instance of the Socket.io `Server` class. Show me an example of this sentence
Ans)Here is an example that demonstrates how to create a new instance of the Socket.io Server class using an HTTP 
server object:
const http = require('http');
const socketio = require('socket.io');

const httpServer = http.createServer();
const io = socketio(httpServer);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('A user connected');
});

httpServer.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('HTTP server listening on port 3000');
});
In this example, the http and socket.io modules are imported using the require function. The http.createServer 
method is then called to create a new HTTP server object, which is stored in the httpServer variable.

The socketio function, which was imported from the socket.io module, is then called with the httpServer object as 
its argument. This creates a new instance of the Socket.io Server class, which is stored in the io variable.

An event listener is then registered on the Socket.io server instance using the on method to listen for the 
connection event. When a new client connects to the server, the callback function passed to the on method is 
called with a socket object representing the connected client as its argument.

Finally, the listen method is called on the HTTP server object to start listening for incoming requests on port 
3000. When the server starts listening, it logs a message to the console indicating that it is ready to accept 
incoming connections.

Q)Based on the previous question- 
But why does again socketio takes httpServer as an argument. why does it need http? Can't it function without http?
If it can't what special extra thing is socket.io providing?
Ans)The `socketio` function takes an HTTP server object as its argument because it needs to attach the Socket.io 
server instance to an existing HTTP server. This allows the Socket.io server to listen for incoming WebSocket 
connections on the same port as the HTTP server, and to share the same underlying network connection.

While it is possible to create a standalone Socket.io server that listens for incoming connections on its own port, 
attaching the Socket.io server to an existing HTTP server has several benefits. For example, it allows clients to 
connect to the Socket.io server using the same hostname and port as the HTTP server, which can simplify the process 
of setting up and configuring the client-side code. It also allows the Socket.io server to reuse the existing 
network connection and infrastructure of the HTTP server, which can improve performance and reduce resource usage.

In summary, the `socketio` function takes an HTTP server object as its argument so that it can attach the Socket.io 
server instance to an existing HTTP server, allowing it to listen for incoming WebSocket connections on the same 
port as the HTTP server and share its underlying network connection.

Q)The `require('socket.io')` function returns a function that can be called with an HTTP server object to create a 
new instance of the Socket.io `Server` class. What is the meaning of the above statement?
