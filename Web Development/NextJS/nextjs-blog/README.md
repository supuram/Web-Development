The `getStaticPaths` function in a Next.js application is used to specify the dynamic routes for which static pages should be pre-generated at build time. In other words, it tells Next.js which specific paths (or URLs) should be available as pre-rendered HTML pages when you build your application.

In your code:

```javascript
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getAllPostIds();
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

- `getStaticPaths` fetches an array of possible paths for your dynamic routes using the `getAllPostIds` function. These paths typically represent the IDs or slugs of your blog posts.

- The `paths` array is returned as part of the object. It specifies the dynamic routes for which you want to generate static HTML pages. In this example, you're indicating that you want to pre-generate static pages for all the post IDs returned by `getAllPostIds`.

- `fallback: false` is set to ensure that Next.js returns a 404 error if a user accesses a URL that doesn't match one of the pre-defined paths. This means that only the paths explicitly defined in `paths` will be accessible as pre-rendered pages, and any other paths will result in a "Not Found" error.

The utility of `getStaticPaths` is in optimizing the performance and SEO of your Next.js application. By specifying which dynamic routes should be pre-generated, you can ensure that these pages are available as static HTML files when users access them. This reduces server load, improves page load times, and enhances search engine optimization (SEO).

In summary, `getStaticPaths` is used to define the specific dynamic routes that should be pre-rendered as static HTML pages at build time, enhancing the performance and SEO of your Next.js application.
