    function b() {

    /*
    Open the example up in a browser and in your text editor.
    Open the JavaScript console in your browser developer tools. In the JavaScript console, enter the following 
    command: output(x);
    You should see the value of variable x printed to the browser viewport.
    Now try entering the following in your console
    output(y);
    output(z);

    Both of these should throw an error into the console along the lines of "ReferenceError: y is not defined". 
    Why is that? Because of function scope — y and z are locked inside the a() and b() functions, so output() 
    can't access them when called from the global scope.
    However, what about when it's called from inside another function? Try editing a() and b() so they look like 
    this:
    function a() {
        const y = 2;
        output(y);
    }

    function b() {
        const z = 3;
        output(z);
    }
    Save the code and reload it in your browser, then try calling the a() and b() functions from the JavaScript 
    console: a();
    b();
    You should see the y and z values printed in the browser viewport. This works fine, as the output() function 
    is being called inside the other functions — in the same scope as the variables it is printing are defined in,
    in each case. output() itself is available from anywhere, as it is defined in the global scope.
